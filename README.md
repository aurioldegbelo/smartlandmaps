# SmartLandMaps Digitization Software

This repository shows the boundary extraction and vectorization code used during the SmartLandMaps project.

The scripts can be found in the /scripts folder.

* boundary_extractor_blur_2023_02 is useful to extract boundaries from the original image (raster-to-raster)
* vectorizer_grass_2023_02 is useful to generate polygons from the boundaries extracted (raster-to-vector)
* OCR_colab_2023_02 helps to extract the stickers from the original image
* analyser_2023_02 is useful for analyzing the results and gives feedback on the number of parcels or stickers that need editing
* joiner_2023_03 merges ODK data with polygons by sticker ID
